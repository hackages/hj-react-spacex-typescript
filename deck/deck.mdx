## TypeScript

- Superset of JavaScript which provides <Important>optional static typing</Important> (classes, interfaces, ...)
- Gives <Important>compile time</Important> guarantees (doesn't check anything at runtime)

<Notes>
  <p>
    TypeScript will let you add optional static typing to your javascript code.
    It's a Superset of JavaScript (not built-in).
  </p>
</Notes>

---

## Example

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  role: Role;
}
```

&nbsp;

```typescript
type Role = 'Admin' | 'Basic';
```

&nbsp;

```typescript
const myUser: User = { name: 'Bouba', age: 28, role: 'Admin' };
```

<Notes>
  <p>We define an interface User which describe what the shape/data of the user should look like (with their type).</p>
  <p>It could be seen like a contract.</p>
  <p>Then we can create an object of this type and typescript will ensure that we respect this contract (types are correct)</p>
</Notes>

## How it works ?

TypeScript checks the code (types) and <Important>analyses it during the compilation.</Important> Then it strips all the
type stuff from the code, and what is left is JavaScript. The <Important>output is untyped</Important>.

<Notes>
  <p>
    TypeScript will check your code (against types) and will analyse it during
    the compilation. Then all the types are removed and what you end up with is
    normal JavaScript
  </p>
</Notes>

---

## Advantages

- <Important>Quick feedback</Important> loop on a lot of errors
- Code base becomes much more <Important>self-documenting</Important> and discoverable
- Helps refactoring / renames, moving stuff around
- Auto-completion and error messages
- <Important>Gradual adoption</Important>

## React SpaceX

<img src={myImg} />

<Notes>
  We will use a working application which displays launches from spacex. We'll
  almost only add types.
</Notes>

---

## Example: Function Component

```typescript
type Props = {
  message: string;
};

const App: React.FC<Props> = ({ message }) => (
  <div>{message}</div>
```

<Notes>
  <p>To give you a quick overview of how we can type a fonctional component:</p>
  <p>We define the type of the props the component should receive. Then when we declare the component, we specify
    that it's a FC for functional component which should receive prop of the type we just defined

  </p>
</Notes>

---

## Example: Class Component

```typescript
type Props = {
  message: string;
};
type State = {
  count: number;
};
class App extends React.Component<Props, State> {
  state { count: 0 };
  render() {
    return <div>{this.props.message} {this.state.count}</div>
  }
}
```

<Notes>
  Same as before but we specify also the type of the State. So we specify what
  the shape of Props/State should look like
</Notes>

---

## Instructions

1. Add types for the <Important>launches</Important> (in the data folder) we'll use in the application. You can add these types in the <Important>types.ts</Important> file

```javascript
const allLaunches = [
  {
    flight_number: 1,
    launch_year: '2006',
    mission_name: 'FalconSat',
    details: 'Engine failure at 33 seconds and loss of vehicle',
    launch_success: false,
  },
];
```

---

## Instructions

2. Add types for the components:

MyComponent.<Important>jsx</Important> -> MyComponent.<Important>tsx</Important>

```typescript
// import MyComponent from './MyComponent.jsx'
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';
```
